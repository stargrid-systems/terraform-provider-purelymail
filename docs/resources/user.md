# Create a user with password_wo (remains in state for change tracking)
resource "purelymail_user" "bob" {
  user_name   = "bob"
  password_wo = "secure-password-456"
}

# Create a user with custom settings and password reset methods
resource "purelymail_user" "charlie" {
  user_name              = "charlie"
  password               = "another-password-789"
